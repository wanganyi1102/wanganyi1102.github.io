## Nanyang Technological University

👩‍🎓 I worked on my bachelor's degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at NTU from 2019 to 2023. Though it was a little stressful at times, it was where I discovered and developed my interests in Machine Learning and AI. I had chances to take on many meaningful projects during the time of my studies, and you can find some of them in the Portfolio and Research Projects sections.

### Key Achievements

First Class Honours (Highest Distinction)

### Activities I enjoyed in NTU

#### Cross Country 🏃‍♀️

I participated in mid/long distance events and actively attended trainings twice a week to build on endurance and
prepare for upcoming events and competitions. It was tough juggling between trainings and studies, but I found it satisfaction in running. What I enjoyed most were the Saturday morning Macritchie runs with friends 🌳🌼

#### Vision of Hope 🧑‍🦯

I participated in goalball games, crossfit and other fun activities with visually impaired persons, supporting them during the activities. It was heartwarming seeing the community being inclusive of everyone and cheering each other on, despite some of them not being able to physically see their peers playing.

#### Art Electives 🎨

I've enjoyed art since young, and took up many art electives in NTU!

#### Language Learning 🇯🇵🇰🇷

One of the things I enjoy is learning new languages. While I've learned Japanese since many years back, I took up advanced Japanese language courses during university days, and challenged myself to JLPT N2! I also picked up elementary Korean at the same time.
