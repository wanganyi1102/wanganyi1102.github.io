## ST Engineering üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

My first full time role after graduation was a data analyst at ST Engineering.

### Key Skills

Computer Vision, Video Analytics, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Automation, RAG, Generative AI, Linux (Ubuntu)

Key Frameworks / Tools: Tensorflow, OpenCV, ScikitLearn, PyOD, MLFlow, LangChain, PowerBI, Git

Programming languages: C++, Python, JS

### Key Projects

### Computer Vision / Video Analytics related projects üëì

- Developed an extensive C++ program to enable smart video analytics and computer vision capabilities in vehicles.
- Developed a program to analyze aerial images and detect threats.

Techniques involved:

- real time image segmentation (few shot / one shot)
- zero-shot object detection
- path planning algorithms
- advanced image processing

### Data Analytics

Spearheaded the development of a condition-based monitoring program. Made use of numerous
Machine Learning and explainable AI techniques for real time monitoring.

### Generative AI

Developed an application for internal stakeholders to interact with a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) model to improve business and operational productivity.

Techniques involved:

- frontend development
- Docker, containerization

### Automation

Created several applications to crawl information from outdated applications to facilitate migration to a newer system, saving several man months of manual effort. Attained top 3 in company‚Äôs productivity innovation challenge due to this initiative.
