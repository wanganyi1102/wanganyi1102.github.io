## Paint-your-mind II: stylistic image creation by concept

Skills: Generative AI, Deep Learning, GAN, ReactJS, Frontend development, Pytorch

- Studied various existing state-of-the-art works on variations of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) (such as [F/LSeSim](https://github.com/lyndonzheng/F-LSeSim), [GauGAN](http://gaugan.org/gaugan2/) ) for image-to-image translation tasks, and trained a model capable of generating paintings of different artistic styles from an input segmentation map.
- Conducted user studies and used ReactJS to develop an interactive web application to showcase the model.
