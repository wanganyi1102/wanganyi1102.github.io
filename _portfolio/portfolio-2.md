Skills: Deep learning, Ensemble learning, Image classification, Computer vision, Siamese network, Tensorflow, keras

- Drove a project to perform kinship recognition based on images of peopleâ€™s faces using a Siamese network.
- Performed ensemble learning to improve model performance.
- Experimented with transfer learning using: ResNet-50, SE-Resnet-50, VGG-16 etc.
- Achieved a high level of accuracy of 88 percent on the binary classification task, placed top 20% on kaggle leaderboard.
