- Conducted studies and developed an original model for text sentiment analysis. The model consisted of bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) layers, self-attention, convolutional layers etc, achieving an accuracy of 92 percent on datasets.
- Conducted multiple experiments and hyperparameter tuning to derive an optimal model.
